Perfect â€“ here's a breakdown for your **deck structure**, with one detailed slide per pillar (4 quadrants each), followed by a final **integration slide**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ **Slide 1: NLP-Based Tariff Sentiment Engine**

**Quadrant 1: Data Sources**  
- News APIs (Bloomberg, Reuters), Twitter/X, official gov releases  
- Keyword filtering (tariffs, trade war, sanctions, retaliation)  
- Time-series structuring of headlines by timestamp  

**Quadrant 2: NLP Techniques**  
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identify countries, companies, sectors  
- **FinBERT / LLM Sentiment Classification**: Label as positive/neutral/negative  
- **Topic Modeling**: Use BERT embeddings + K-Means/LDA to detect thematic clusters  

**Quadrant 3: Output Construction**  
- Generate **daily sentiment scores** for countries/sectors  
- Apply **exponential decay** to model sentiment persistence  
- Weight by source credibility (e.g., more weight to Bloomberg than Twitter)  

**Quadrant 4: Use Case**  
- **Detect real-time tariff escalation signals**  
- Early warning for FX/equity de-risking trades  
- Overlay with capital flow data (e.g., USDCNH + Northbound flows)

## ðŸ”¹ **Slide 2: Kalshi & Polymarket Signal Layer**

**Quadrant 1: Event Market Selection**  
- Scrape Kalshi & Polymarket for tariff-related contracts  
- Examples:  
  - "Will US impose new tariffs on China before Q3?"  
  - "Will EU retaliate with car tariffs by June?"

**Quadrant 2: Signal Features**  
- **Implied Probabilities** (market consensus)  
- **Price Momentum** (shift in odds = rising conviction)  
- **Volatility** = disagreement = potential inflection point  
- **Time Decay** = urgency effect as expiration nears  

**Quadrant 3: Interpretation Engine**  
- Convert prediction market moves into **forward-looking sentiment delta**  
- Use as **weighting factor** for NLP sentiment index  
- Create **alerts** on high-conviction event changes  

**Quadrant 4: Use Case**  
- Combine with NLP for **probabilistic scenario mapping**  
- Position ahead of anticipated tariff announcements  
- Trade **event-driven volatility** in FX/EM equity

## ðŸ”¹ **Slide 3: Tariff Beta Estimation Framework**

**Quadrant 1: Historical Beta Model**  
- Define event windows:  
  - e.g., US-China tariff rounds (2018, 2019)  
- Regress returns (Y) on event index (X) â†’ compute beta  
- **Dynamic rolling window** to track evolution over time  

**Quadrant 2: Asset Mapping**  
- **FX**: USDCNH, KRW, MXN, AUD  
- **Equity**: Semiconductors, Industrials, Autos  
- **Credit**: HY bonds with EM exposure  

**Quadrant 3: Beta Portfolio Construction**  
- Rank assets by tariff beta  
- Long/short baskets based on sentiment regime  
- Weight by volatility-adjusted beta exposure  

**Quadrant 4: Use Case**  
- Identify **high-sensitivity trades** for risk-on/off positioning  
- Avoid false positives by focusing on **historically reactive assets**  
- Build **systematic trade filters** based on beta quantiles

## ðŸ”¹ **Slide 4: Integration Framework â€“ From Signals to Trades**

**Quadrant 1: Signal Overlay**  
- **NLP Tariff Sentiment Score** (real-time signal)  
- **Kalshi/Polymarket Probabilities** (event-driven conviction)  
- **Tariff Beta Ranking** (asset sensitivity)

**Quadrant 2: Trade Signal Engine**  
- Signal = f(NLP Ã— Kalshi Ã— Beta)  
- Generate directional signals for FX, EM, sector equities  
- Assign conviction levels (low, med, high)

**Quadrant 3: Execution + Risk Layer**  
- Volatility-adjusted sizing  
- Optional Kelly Criterion scaling  
- Stop-loss based on rolling volatility / macro regime shifts

**Quadrant 4: Deployment & Monitoring**  
- Live dashboard (Python + Streamlit / Power BI)  
- Alert system (email / Slack integration)  
- Backtested performance by strategy vertical
